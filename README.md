```
Boy, we've had a real good time
And I wish you the best
on your way, eh-eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought
we'd fall out of place,
eh-eh, hey
I had something that
I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, eh-eh
I wish he never looked at me
that way Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, hey
Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so
compliquées, eh-eh
I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's money,
eh, eh-eh, hey
I had something that
I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, eh-eh
I wish he never looked at me
that way Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, hey
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh, hey, yeah
I had something that
I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me
that something's wrong
Then I met someone
And eh, there's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else
I can say Eh-eh, eh-eh
Wish he never looked at me
that way Eh-eh, hey-eh-ey
There's nothing else
I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else
I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
I wish he never looked at me
that way Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh,
all I can say is "eh-eh"
